description: "Our concern is the modular development of a certified static analyzer in Coq: we extend a certified abstract domain of convex polyhedra with a linearization procedure approximating polynomial expressions. In order to help such a development, we propose a proof framework, embedded in Coq, that implements a refinement calculus."
