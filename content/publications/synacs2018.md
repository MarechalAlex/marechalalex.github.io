description: "The Verified Polyhedra Library operates upon a constraint-only representation of convex polyhedra and provides all common operations (image, pre-image, projection, convex hull, widening, inclusion and equality tests.. .). Optionally, the soundness of the results is checked by a layer certified in Coq."
